# Forest-Footprint-Explorer-2001-2023
Visualizations of global forest cover trends.

Overview
--------
This project is a data visualization dashboard created as part of a Master's program assignment. The "Forest Footprint Explorer: 2001-2023" communicates insights on global tree cover loss from 2001 to 2023, targeting environmental policymakers, conservation organizations, and academic researchers. The dashboard uses data from Global Forest Watch (accessed 25th March 2025) to highlight trends, regional contributions, and yearly spikes in deforestation, emphasizing the need for action.

Purpose
-------
The dashboard aims to:
- Provide high-level insights through a time-series line plot, regional bar chart, treemap, trajectory plot, and global map.
- Enable detailed analysis with interactive features like "Show history" and year selection (2001-2029).
- Balance clarity and depth for diverse stakeholders, as evaluated in the accompanying report.

Files Included
--------------
- Global_Forest_Watch_Data.csv
- Forest_Footprint_Explorer_Report.JPG
Requirements
------------
- Tableau Desktop 2022.4 or later to open and interact with the .twbx file.
- Internet access to retrieve the dataset from Global Forest Watch if needed.

Instructions
------------
1. Open Forest_Footprint_Explorer_Dashboard.twbx in Tableau Desktop to explore the dashboard.
2. Use the "Show history" filter on the map and year slider on the trajectory plot to interact with the data.
3. Refer to Forest_Footprint_Explorer_Report.PDF for the evaluation of design choices and Appendix.txt for creation steps.
4. Access the dataset at globalforestwatch.org (search for "Tree Cover Loss 2001-2023") if further analysis is required.
